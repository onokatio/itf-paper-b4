In this era, collecting user's personal data and calcuating stat for multiple usecase is modern stuff.
But delegate such datas to external organization in easily makes data unexpected exposing or being used with nonlegal way.
A some way for protect it exists, and diffirential privacy is also one of them.
In this research we use diffirential privacy and sandbox technologies.
Accroding them any proccess written by any language can filter, procces and calcuate datas except output data to outside without agreement.
Even outputting data, the procces can't use raw data and should expose only results which was be noised with diffirential privacy.
These step can make possible to calcuate stat more flexible without exposing private data than ever.
We developed a framework from these design, and verified an effectivity with running stat calcuating program.
